## International Keynote

**Assistant Professor Chun-Hung Yeh**
Chang Gung University, Taiwan

*Talk Title: Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Analyses of Psychiatric Conditions Using Diffusion MRI*

Chun-Hung Yeh is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences at Chang Gung University (CGU) in Taiwan. He joined CGU in 2020 as an Assistant Research Fellow at the Institute for Radiological Research. Before that, from 2014 to 2019, he was a Senior Research Officer in the Imaging Division led by Professor Alan Connelly at the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Melbourne, Australia. Dr. Yeh has a long-standing interest in the application of novel diffusion imaging method developments to significant clinical neuroscience challenges. He is currently leading multiple local and international projects, including the EBRAINS initiative funded by the Horizon Europe Framework Programme. His research group focuses primarily on mental health conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder, using a multi-modality approach that incorporates diffusion, functional, and structural MRI, positron emission tomography (PET), and plasma biomarkers. Additionally, his group is contributing to the advancement of transcranial brain stimulation protocols to treat psychiatric symptoms.

## National Keynote

**Professor Martin Ugander**
University of Sydney, Australia

*Talk Title: Cardiovascular MRI for heart disease phenotyping*

Professor Martin Ugander, MD, PhD, is since 2019 Professor of Cardiac Imaging and since 2020 Director of Clinical Imaging, both at the University of Sydney. He leads the University of Sydney Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Research Group as well as the Sydney Clinical Imaging Network. He was born 1975 in Sweden, and grew up in the USA. He was awarded an MD in 2001 and PhD in 2006 from Lund University, Sweden. 2009-2011 he was a Post-doctoral Research Fellow in Cardiovascular MRI and CT at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA. 2011-2019 he undertook clinical training in the medical specialty Clinical Physiology at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, where he also founded and led the Karolinska Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Group at the Karolinska Institute. His research interest is in non-invasive cardiac imaging in general and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in particular, with a focus on the diagnoses ischemic heart disease, myocarditis, and heart failure, as well as basic cardiac pumping physiology. His research traverses cardiology, radiology, nuclear medicine, and physiology, while spanning technical, pre-clinical translational, and clinical cardiovascular imaging.

## Call for Abstracts

ISMRM ANZ welcomed abstracts describing new research, development, and applications in the field of magnetic resonance in medicine and biology and other related topics. The abstract submission process was streamlined requiring a simple 200 word abstract, with encouragement for resubmission of abstracts submitted to other events. Early Career Researchers were encouraged to present, with presentation awards available.

**Abstract Deadline**: Friday 22 November 2024, 11.55PM AEDT
